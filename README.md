# rscrn
An easier and faster AutoHotkey alternative. Yes, it's actually faster.

## Caveat
**Has minimal functionality**. It is only able to simply paste the provided CRNs (arguments provided) then end with ENTER.

## Reliability
I've used this myself for years and it works great. Really doesn't make much of a difference due to the difference in network speeds that most people have, but I mostly use it because it's simpler to use.

## Liability
**Use at your own risk**. This is a personal project of mine. It does work, but that's just me telling you that it works.
