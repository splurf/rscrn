# rscrn
An easier and faster AutoHotkey alternative. Yes, it's actually faster.

## Usage
1. Download the executable [here](https://github.com/splurf/rscrn/releases/tag/v0.1.0).
2. In your terminal, run the following command:
```bash
rscrn.exe --help
```
- If you're on Windows, the command will most likely look like this:
```cmd
%USERPROFILE%\Downloads\rscrn.exe --help
```

## Example
```bash
rscrn.exe 51412 51413 52288 52062 52093
```

## Caveat
**Has minimal functionality**. It is only able to simply paste the provided CRNs (arguments provided) then end with ENTER.

## Reliability
I've used this myself for years and it works great. Really doesn't make much of a difference due to the difference in network speeds that most people have, but I mostly use it because it's simpler to use.

## Liability
**Use at your own risk**. This is a personal project of mine. It does work, but that's just me telling you that it works.
